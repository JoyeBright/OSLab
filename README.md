## Contents

* ### Process Creation
  System calls consist of fork(), exect(), wait()

* ### The CPU Scheduling Algorithms
  FCFS, SJF, RR and also other Algorithms will be programmed by students in different iterations.

* ### The Disk Scheduling Algorithms
  FCFS, LCFS and also other Algorithms will be programmed by students in different iterations.

* ### Project Management Using Make GNU
  Makefile, GNUMakefile

* ### Threads
  POSIX Pthreads: Thread Creation and Termination - Sum of 0 to N (via 2 threads and multiple threads)<br>
  Windows Thread(C#): Thread Creation and Termination - Sum of 0 to N (via 2 threads and multiple threads)

* ### Exchange of Information:
  Pipe, Shared-Memory

* ### Synchronization
  Solving the Producer-Consumer Problem Using Semaphores<br>

* ### Virtual Memory Management
  Translates logical to physical addresses for a virtual address space by using Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) <br> <b>* There is no page fault handling</b>

## Supported PLs
Major parts of the project have been coded with C.<br>
Also, some experiments have been coded with C-family PLs.
